            <br>DAVE: &quot;Hello, and welcome to our show, Today&#39;s Tomorrows! <br>

            <br>&quot;I&#39;m your host, the spectacularly imposing collective known as Dave. It&#39;s Decembler 3rd, 4466 (Universal date 99.198901). I hope you&#39;re all feeling great— I know I am! 
            <br>
            <br>&quot;Now, usually we use our entirely unique and patented time travel machine, &#39;Bessie&#39;, to send our nervous and contractually obligated reporter, Frank, to the future to see what&#39;s ahead.  Past discoveries have included the founding of Earth 4, the cloning of Zenitian Bowlers, and Frank&#39;s embarassing death. Wonderful topics, all; but today, we have something a little more interesting for you. We thought, sure, we&#39;ve all enjoyed learning about what is to come, seeing all the ways humanity will change. It&#39;s become part of all our morning routines—sonic shower, splash a little Decay Away on our teeth, check Today&#39;s Tomorrows on the holo. And it&#39;s a good routine! A great one. Frank never fails to bring us something interesting.
         </p>

         <p>&quot;But I had a thought--what if we spice things up a little? So (oh, this is a good one!), we decided to send Frank to the PAST! I know, why would we ever want to do that?  It&#39;s all just boring metal enclosures, and the 85 year long recitation of the AI/Robot accords, right? Nothing interesting there. Nothing new. 
         </p>
         <p>&quot;Except, there&#39;s mounting evidence from archaeologists, historians, and scientists, that humanity&#39;s past might have held more than what we know about. Just last week, Bobson Data2-Bobs and their crack team dug up evidence of layers of bio-material underneath the expected metal and plastic layers. They found all sorts of dna evidence that Earth 1 hosted life before the orderly metal-enclosed lives of our history books. So we thought, why the hell not? Frank just got back from seeing his own future death; it&#39;s time to send him out again, but to the past! What will he bring us this time?
         </p>

         <p>&quot;Now, I want to caution you as we proceed, that we do not know what is back there. We may not find anything more than a few simple microscopic bioliforms. We may not find anything at all. This has never been done. But we sure hope we find something interesting for Frank to report back to us with! 10 cycles ago, earlier this morning, we set Bessie&#39;s dial to go as far back as we could think of, so far back we had to use negatives to date it:  -5190.  We popped Frank in there, and initiated the time jump. As of right now, we have not talked to Frank. We do not know what we&#39;ve sent him into. And now, we all get to find out together! So, without further ado, Frank, tell us what you see!&quot;

         <p>FRANK: &quot;Hello. I&#39;m standing here, on Earth1, in the past—the year -5190. And I gotta tell you, it&#39;s just full of bio life! Bessie and I poofed into what looks like a whole other planet. There&#39;s biolife everywhere!  In the sky, in the water, in the floor, on every single surface. I&#39;ve never seen so many colors, and textures; and there&#39;s all these weird sounds. 
         </p>
         <p>&quot;Oh, look! Right now, a very small little creature with wings is approaching! I&#39;ll take a picture for those abstaining from moving recordings(it will be available in the transcipts, for those of you who prefer to read your news). I&#39;m going to try to make contact, speak to him. I have my Braino Universal Translator app running, so I should be understood.

         </figure>
         <p>&quot;Hello! I greet you with peaceful intent, and desired communication. My name is Frank; what is yours?  He&#39;s getting closer, and closer, flying up to my face like a tiny little drone! I think he&#39;s responding! I hear his voice, but it isn&#39;t being translated! It&#39;s a strange buzzing sound. He&#39;s getting closer. Oh! Oh no! Why? Ow! No! Noooooooo! He has attacked me, without provocation! He has hurt my face! I&#39;m, I&#39;m going to try to get away. I&#39;m  hoping that I haven&#39;t accidently started a war with his kind, and also that he doesn&#39;t try to hurt me further. I see some strange structures a short distance away—brown and green, and very tall. I do not know what they are, but perhaps whoever built them will give me sanctuary. The floor here is odd too—covered in green stuff that&#39;s soft and slippery, and underneath it something brown has leaked through in places. I wish I could investigate further, but I must flee my attacker!
         </p>
         <p>&quot;Ah, I&#39;ve made it. I don&#39;t think my attacker followed me. I&#39;m going to take a moment and sit down on some of this odd brown and green floor material, rest for a bit. Oh! It&#39;s wet! Oh no, oh gross, gross, gross! I do hope I&#39;m not sitting on the bio-export materials of some creature. It does smell odd though. 
         </p>

         <p>&quot;I&#39;m right next to the tall structures I mentioned earlier. They don&#39;t seem to be hollow, or to contain any beings that I can see. 'Hello. Hello, anyone.' They aren&#39;t responding in any audible or visible way to my greeting. They have fluffy hair on the ends of their limbs, and many many limbs. They do not seem dangerous, but of course I do not know that for sure. Their hair provides some amount of shade from the sun, which is welcome, as there is no protective glass and I&#39;m concerned about such dangerous exposure to the prehistoric light.

         <p>&quot;As I sit here, I hear a sound—a scratching and a chittering—that&#39;s getting louder. I&#39;m trying to locate the source. It&#39;s above me, in one of the structures! It&#39;s about the size of my hands, brown, and quite hairy all over. It has pointy ears, a bushy tail, and formidable claws. It&#39;s getting closer, and it&#39;s climbing down the structure, all while loudly yelling at me. My translator is translating it now. Oh. Oh no! I can&#39;t say that on air! This is a family show! That&#39;s utterly repulsive! What a vile creature this is! He&#39;s swearing at me, calling me names. Oh my goodness, he does seem to have a flair for insults. He wants me gone! He&#39;s threatening me. It seems he owns this whole realm, and he doesn&#39;t want me here. I guess I was wrong in assuming that these structures did not hold anyone. He must rule this city. I do hope he treats his subjects better than this!

         <p>&#39;It seems that it&#39;s time to head back to Bessie. It will be a tricky feat to get past the flying creatures without incident, all while avoiding the structures this creature has banished me from, but it seems I have no choice. My face is damaged from my earlier encounter with the micro bio-drone, and I fear more injuries from his kind. This is a lawless land, full of terrifying and violent life. I fear I may not make it back. I must be strong. If I do get back, I am seriously disputing my contract again! I can&#39;t do this anymore. Send someone else! Please send anyone else…&quot;

         <br>
         <p>DAVE:  &quot;Thank you, Frank! Good luck. And your contract is impenetrable! Ha! <br>
            <br>&quot;Well, the distant past was certainly not what we thought it was, was it? Turns out there was a time before our beautiful, peaceful metal world existed, and it was horrible, full of angry hairy beings who lived in vast cities of thin towers, squishy floors covered in excrement, and tiny violent drone-like creatures that attacked without warning or reason. I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m pretty happy to be floating right here, right now. 
         </p>
         <p>&quot;Next up is a segment on how to keep your metals shiny, and after that, we&#39;ve got a real treat for you—our local leaders (BOTH AI and robot) will be stopping by, and I&#39;m hoping we can convince them to take some selfies with our Glam Cam! Wouldn&#39;t it just be the best? Ah, well. First though, a word from our sponsor, 01101111 01110110 01100101 01110010 01101100 01101111 01110010 01100100! See you guys soon!&quot;
